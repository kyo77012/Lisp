# Lisp OurScheme
=====================================
This is my PL course project that is to make a Lisp interpreter.
But the syntax of Lisp have some change.(Look "ThreeLisps.txt" for details.)
If you want to know the syntax, please check "syntax.txt".
Look "OurSchemeProj1~4.txt" for primitive funtions and example.
